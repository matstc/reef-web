<p><img alt="" src="reef-volunteers_73_1721356635.jpg" style="height: 95px; width: 169px; float: left" /><strong>Shawn Tabb</strong> is originally from Midland, Michigan but currently resides Litchfield Park, Arizona. Shawn obtained an Associates degree in Electronics from Glendale Community College and has worked in the Semiconductor Industry since 1994. Shawn currently works for Intel in Process Engineering. Not content with his current job, Shawn decided to return to school and obtain his Bachelor&rsquo;s in Business Administration. After two years of hard work Shawn received a degree from Northern Arizona University, graduating Magna Cum Laude.<br />
<br />
Volunteering was a way for Shawn to accomplish two goals; make a difference helping contribute to a worthwhile cause along with gaining real world experience in Project Management to enrich his career. In addition to volunteering at REEF, Shawn also donates his time to a local organization dedicated to promoting responsible recreation on public lands.<br />
<br />
When those rare moments of free time do occur, Shawn likes to spend the time outdoors with his family. The Tabb family enjoys camping, exploring and taking in all the activities being outdoors offers. Other free time activities include spending as much time as possible with his two teenage children before they go off to college.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="reef-volunteers_22_3102110669.png" style="float: left; width: 155px; height: 116px" /><strong><span style="font-size: 13px">Sydney Larson</span></strong>&nbsp;is a San Francisco Bay Area native and a &quot;California girl&quot; through and through. At Vanderbilt University Sydney majored in molecular biology and minored in music. But, she had a change of heart her final semester and decided to look for a job in renewable energy. Since graduation, Sydney has been working for a solar company called SunRun which, in her 4 years there, has grown from a tiny start-up to one of the nation's largest residential solar companies.</p>
&nbsp;
<p>Sydney is extremely passionate about renewable energy and believes that, at this juncture in the world's history, a sustainable energy infrastructure will serve as the necessary foundation for any successful economy. Accordingly, she is thrilled to be volunteering for REEF in order to help developing nations build energy infrastructures that will allow their economies to grow and pull their people out of poverty. &nbsp;In her free time Sydney enjoys skiing, rock climbing, yoga, exploring San Francisco, and cooking.&nbsp;</p>
&nbsp;
<p><img alt="" src="reef-volunteers_67_3805434770.png" style="height: 166px; width: 166px; float: left" /><strong>Manimala Kumar</strong> grew up in India. Shortly after finishing B.E. in Electrical Engineering and a post graduation in Information Technology she moved to USA. Hopping and working in many states from east to west, she landed up in the Bay Area. She works full time as an IT project manager.<br />
She was lucky to be in a college nestled in lush green Himalayas. She stayed connected with nature during excursions at various places in India. She happened to work with smart grid software and developed interest in energy and related technologies. Being from a developing country she understands lack of energy infrastructure and sustainability movement there. She hopes to help REEF to prove it&rsquo;s idea and expand subsequently.<br />
<br />
In her spare time she loves to do cultural programs, sing, dance, photograph, read, travel, hike and play with her kid.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="reef-volunteers_24_488327268.png" style="float: left; width: 165px; height: 121px" /><strong>Randall Aluwi</strong>grew up for the majority of his life in Jakarta, Indonesia, until moving to the U.S. where he attended Carnegie Mellon University receiving a degree in Business Administration. After graduating, he moved to Sacramento, California to work at a private equity consulting firm.<br />
<br />
Randall currently resides in San Francisco, California and works at an investment banking firm. He enjoys volunteering at organizations serving the underprivileged communities in Asia. Back in Indonesia, he was an active participant in community service oriented organizations. He is also excited about learning more about the renewable energy space building upon his previous internship at a clean energy focused private equity firm. He looks forward to contributing to the development of REEF.</p>
&nbsp;
<p><strong>Hareesh Gali</strong> is our youngest volunteer, talented beyond his years. He wrote to REEF asking for a volunteer position as a web developer. When his age came up we were at a lost as to whether to bring him on board but his perseverance impressed us and with his mother's backing we gladly extended a position. Hareesh at a young age is an accomplished web developer with certificates of web development from Northwestern University. Today Hareesh has made significant contributions to improve our website's navigation and added new features, and at the moment he is in the midst of our second editon efforts. This project will keep him busy for 2-3 months.<br />
<br />
This past Thanksgiving (2011) he wrote:</p>
&nbsp;
<div style="padding-left: 60px; padding-right: 60px">Hi Mr.Chesley,<br />
&quot;I am very thankful this thanksgiving because you decided to give me an opportunity to work on your site, this is invaluable to me because it gives me an opportunity to learn and meet new people as well as complete high school requirements ahead of time. So thank you for giving such a great oppurtunity to work on your site.&quot;</div>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;This was posted to share with others that age should never be a consideration when it comes to volunteerism.&nbsp;</p>

<div><img alt="" src="reef-volunteers_54_1653132256.jpg" style="height: 120px; float: left; width: 160px" /><strong>Patrick Kagema</strong> grew up on the slopes of Mount Kenya in East Africa, where he was designing and promoting renewable energy based youth entrepreneurship activities. He trained as an Agricultural Engineer who has developed a special interest and accumulated numerous working experiences in renewable energy technologies for over two years. He recently moved to California where he intends to further his experience with renewable energy. He shares his brilliant design and writing skills with REEF as a creator of online marketing content and presentations.

While out of office, Patrick loves reading, watching movies, travelling and exploring the urban jungle.</div>
<p><img alt="" src="reef-volunteers_28_2132469491.png" style="float: left; width: 135px; height: 169px" /><strong>Shirleyanne Zosa</strong>&nbsp;is our Community Outreach Manager and her role is to network with other groups, communities and professionals that want to help improve the lives of struggling communities in the Philippines. She earned her Bachelors of Science in Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology from the University of California, Santa Cruz. She was born and raised in the Philippines and is fluent in Waray-waray and Tagalog. Growing up in the Philippines made her aware of the hardships that many people face, especially ones that reside in rural communities. When she was younger, her father used to take the whole family to the province for vacations and she has experienced first-hand what it feels like to live in a home without electricity. This lesson taught her the significance of accessibility to electricity. Working for REEF has educated her in the other benefits of electricity and even greater benefits of renewable energy technologies.<br />
<br />
She joined REEF because she wanted to give back to her impoverished countrymen by helping them find respite from the hardships that they experience in their lives. She felt that it is more important to devote family income to education and health instead of using this small income for inefficient energy sources. She is an active member of Young Filipino Professionals Association (YFPA) and she currently works full-time as a Quality Control Analyst for Bayer Healthcare. In her spare time, she enjoys snowboarding, cooking, travelling and playing fetch with her cat.&nbsp;</p><br />
